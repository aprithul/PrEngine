A custom C++ game engine in making. It's basically a higher level structure around SDL2. The target is to make SDL2 work more like a well structured engine while still using the SDL2 functinoalities internally.

Also, don't know if Xcode project will still work or not ( leaving the configuration files as-is though). Using g++ ( cpp 11) now.
